# SimpleExploitFixer
A Simple Exploit Fixer plugin that aims to fix most lag machines and patch exploits as they arise

## Currently
Exploit fixer plugin to patch new exploits as they arise and lag exploits as well.. This plugin is also aimed towards a 1.16-1.16.5 audience, and I don't intend on helping out other versions with this plugin currently.
I basically got tired of making a new plugin every time someone lags my server.

## Future
In the future I would like to add some more exploits, clean up the code, and also add Bstats.

## Notes
If you would like to report a new exploit, please dm KRYMZ0N#0001 on Discord
