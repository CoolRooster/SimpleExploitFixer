# SimpleExploitFixer
A Simple Exploit Fixer plugin that aims to fix most lag machines 

## Currently
Currently it only covers the bee exploit but I plan on adding all the ones I know of into this. This plugin is also aimed towards a 1.16-1.16.5 audience, and I don't intend on helping out other versions with this plugin currently.
I basically got tired of making a new plugin every time someone lags my server.
