# SimpleExploitFixer
A Simple Exploit Fixer plugin that aims to fix most lag machines and patch exploits as they arise

## Currently
Exploit fixer plugin to patch new exploits as they arise and lag exploits as well.. This plugin is aimed towards a 1.18-1.18.2 audience.

## Future
In the future I would like to add some more exploits, clean up the code, and also add Bstats.

## Notes
If you would like to report a new exploit, please dm CoolRooster#1523 on Discord or join this discord https://discord.gg/fustWrP4
